        <h1>Welcome to Game Finder</h1>
        <h2>What is Game Finder?</h2>
        <p>Have you ever spent hours going through lists and lists of games you want
            to play but end up not finding anything because your itching for something <strong>super specific</strong>?
            well I have, and I made this website so finding games whithin certain genres or combinations of them
            can be made easier for myself and all of you.
        </p>

        <h3>My Favorite games</h3>
        <p>just so this page is not super empty and devoid of content here is a list of my favorite games:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hellblade Senua's Sacrifice</li>
            <li>Sekiro Shadows Die Twice</li>
            <li>Resident Evil 4 Remake</li>
            <li>Assassins Creed Odessey</li>
            <li>Ori and the will of the Wisp</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Current State</h2>
        <p>Currently Game Finder is just this measly little html index page with no styling what so ever
            but as I progressively become better at web developement Game Finder will also become better.
        </p>
        <p>Here is the list of my next three steps</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Finish writing the content of my landing page</li>
            <li>Learn CSS and apply some styling to the landing page</li>
            <li>Create a game page to display game info</li>
        </ol>
