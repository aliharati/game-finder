        <h1>Welcome to Game Finder</h1>
        <h3>What is Game Finder?</h3>
        <p>Have you ever spent hours going through lists and lists of games you want
            to play but end up not finding anything because your itching for something <strong>super specific</strong>?
            well I have, and I made this website so finding games whithin certain genres or combinations of them
            can be made easier for myself and all of you.
        </p>

        <h3>Current State</h2>
        <p>Currently Game Finder is just this measly little html index page with no styling what so ever
            but as I progressively become better at web developement Game Finder will also become better.
